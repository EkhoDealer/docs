## Payment Selection
The payment method selected by the buyer. This will be initialized to whatever payment option the buyer selects at Checkout, but note that - in certain cases - it can change thereafter (e.g. if the buyer chooses financing at Checkout, gets rejected, and then chooses to pay in cash in the Buyer Portal). This can be one of the following values:
{/* Native financing: buyer chose to finance the order through our lending partner 
Checkout full payment: buyer chose to pay in full at checkout 
Cash: buyer chose to pay in cash closer to delivery date 
Cash early: buyer chose to pay in cash during the financing section  */}
{/* Use the values from above to create a list */}
 - `Native Financing`: The buyer has chosen to finance the vehicle through Ekho's in-house financing system. We've automated the process to make it as seamless as possible for the buyer, and leverage different lender partners based on the the `vehicleType` of the vehicle in question.
 - `Other financing (not currently supported)`: The buyer has chosen to finance the vehicle through a third-party lender. This could be a bank, credit union, or other financial institution.
 - `Checkout Full Payment`: The buyer has chosen to pay in full at checkout (via card).
 - `Cash`:  The buyer has chosen to pay the balance of their order in cash closer to the delivery date. It also means that the buyer paid a reservation fee at checkout.
 - `Cash Early`: The buyer has seleected to pay the balance of their order in cash after checkout, but in the financing (i.e. the first) section in the Buyer Portal. This either means the buyer paid a reservation fee at Checkout, or that they were rejected for financing and chose to pay in cash instead (this is rarely happens). 

## Payment Status
This property is used to describe the current state of payment for a particular vehicle order. It changes over time as we receive payments from the buyer. This can be one of the following values:
{/* No payments: no payments have been received (i.e. buyer selects financing at checkout) 
Down payment paid: buyer paid financing down payment
Reservation paid: buyer paid reservation fee at checkout
Fully paid: no remaining balance due for the order
Financing guaranteed: funding packet for financed order submitted to the financing lender */}
 - `No Payments`: No payments have been received for the vehicle order. Payment status is initially set to this value when the buyer selects financing at Checkout. 
 - `Down Payment Paid`: The buyer has paid the down payment for the vehicle orde. This is the first payment received for a financed order.
 - `Reservation Paid`: The buyer has paid the reservation fee at Checkout. This is the first payment received for a cash order.
