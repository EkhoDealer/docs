## How does Ekho handle third-party analytics?

### Overview

Ekho provides integrations with common third-party analytics platforms. Custom workflows can be built for more complex use cases.

### Which third-party analytics platforms has Ekho integrated with?

Ekho currently supports Google Analytics (which can be a GTM integration or a direct GA4 tag integration), Meta Pixel, and TikTok Pixel. Reach out to the team on Slack to discuss integrations with other platforms. Simultaneous integrations with all of these platforms are supported.

### How can I add my third-party analytics tracking to my Ekho instance?

Reach out to the team at Ekho with your GTM ID, GA4 tag ID, Meta Pixel ID, or TikTok Pixel ID and we will set things up for you.

## Analytics Events In Ekho Buyer Portal

Ekho does not support direct integrations with third-party analytics in the buyer portal. However, custom workflows can be built using Ekho ºs Zapier integration to ensure events downstream from checkout are sent to analytics platforms.
