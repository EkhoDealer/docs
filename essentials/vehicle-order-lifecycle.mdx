### Preorder Steps

<Steps>
	<Step title='Buyer Places a Preorder'>
		A buyer will appear in the "Preorders" tab once they place their [Ekho
		Preorder](/essentials/ekho-glossary#ekho-preorder).
		<br /> **-- Preorder status:** Awaiting Conversion
		<br /> **-- Available buttons:** Convert Preorder, Cancel and Refund
	</Step>
	<Step title='Convert Preorder'>
		When you are ready to convert a preorder click the "Convert Preorder"
		button to notify the buyer. This button should be clicked when the OEM
		is ready to begin production of the preordered unit shortly and would
		like to invite the buyer, via white-label email and text, to complete
		their [Ekho Checkout](/essentials/ekho-glossary#ekho-checkout). See
		[Ekho
		Communications](/essentials/ekho-communications#preorder-conversion) for
		email copy.
		<br /> **-- Preorder status:** Awaiting Conversion
		<br /> **-- Available buttons:** Preview Cart (preview link of buyer’s
		unique checkout basket), Cancel and Refund
	</Step>
	<Step title='Buyer Completes Checkout'>
		A buyer completes checkout using their unique link provided in email and
		SMS when the OEM clicks "Convert Preorder". At [Ekho
		Checkout](/essentials/ekho-glossary#ekho-checkout) they can select to
		either pay in full or apply for financing. Upon checkout completion it
		will become a [Pending Order](/essentials/ekho-glossary#pending-order)
		and eventually a [Converted
		Order](/essentials/ekho-glossary#converted-order). The preorder is ready
		for OEM action only when the buyer completes all the steps to get their
		order into the ["Awaiting OEM
		Action"](/essentials/vehicle-order-lifecycle#awaiting-oem-action) tab.
		<br /> **-- Preorder status:** Converted
		<br /> **-- Available buttons:** N/A as the order is no longer a
		preorder
	</Step>
	<Step title='Complete!'>
		The preorder will now begin its journey from a [Pending
		Order](/essentials/ekho-glossary#pending-order) to a [Converted
		Order](/essentials/ekho-glossary#converted-order)!
	</Step>
</Steps>
<Info>
	**Cancellations & Refunds:** At this point, the OEM is not able to
	self-serve cancel and refund the preorder. If a converted preorder would
	like to cancel and refund (i.e. financing rejected, does not want to sign
	the binding Purchase Agreement, etc.), please reach out to Ekho, and we will
	check if their cancellation request abides by our cancellation policy.
