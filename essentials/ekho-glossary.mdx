-   [Coming soon] Third party financing: the buyer will bring in their own financing through (i.e. local credit union, personal financing, etc.)
-   [Coming soon] Pay by ACH: the buyer will pay the full balance or reservation amount via ACH / bank transfer

### Prequalification

### Submit Financing Application

### Pending Order

Once an order is placed through Ekho Checkout, it will become a Pending Order. Please reference ["Pending Orders"](/essentials/vehicle-order-lifecycle#pending-orders) for more details on the prerequisites for an order to becom a Converted Order.

### Converted Order

An order will be "converted" once it completes all the prerequisites listed in ["Pending Orders"](/essentials/vehicle-order-lifecycle#pending-orders). At this point, the order is no longer cancelable or refundable (certain terms may apply).

## Financing

### Conditional Offer

A buyer has received a conditional offer from the lender pending additional information to clear certain stipulations. The most common stipulations requested include, but are not limited to, proof of income, residence, addiitional income, and personal references. When the buyer provides all the necessary documentation to clear the stipulations, they will receive a full Financing Offer.

### Financing Offer

A buyer receives a final financing offer from the lender, either approved, counteroffered, or rejected.

### Retail Installment Contract (RIC)

The final financing contract signed by the buyer that "locks" in the deal. Once signed, a financing order is no longer eligble for a cancelation or refund. It is important to note that the RIC is only available when the OEM marks the order as ["Ready to Ship"](essentials/vehicle-order-lifecycle#awaiting-oem-action) in the Admin Portal.

## Payment Selection

The payment method selected by the buyer. This will be initialized to whatever payment option the buyer selects at Checkout, but note that - in certain cases - it can change thereafter (e.g. if the buyer chooses financing at Checkout, gets rejected, and then chooses to pay in cash in the Buyer Portal). This can be one of the following values:

### Native Financing

The buyer has chosen to finance the vehicle through Ekho's in-house financing system. We've automated the process to make it as seamless as possible for the buyer and leverage different lender partners based on the `vehicleType` of the vehicle in question.

### [Coming Soon] Other Financing

The buyer has chosen to finance the vehicle through a third-party lender. This could be a bank, credit union, or other financial institution.

### Checkout Full Payment

The buyer has chosen to pay in full at checkout (via card).

### Cash

The buyer has chosen to pay the balance of their order in cash closer to the delivery date. It also means that the buyer paid a reservation fee at checkout.

### Cash Early

The buyer has selected to pay the balance of their order in cash after checkout, but in the financing (i.e. the first) section in the Buyer Portal. This either means the buyer paid a reservation fee at Checkout, or that they were rejected for financing and chose to pay in cash instead (this rarely happens).

## Payment Status

This property is used to describe the current state of payment for a particular vehicle order. It changes over time as we receive payments from the buyer. This can be one of the following values:

### No Payments

No payments have been received for the vehicle order. Payment status is initially set to this value when the buyer selects financing at Checkout.

### Down Payment Paid

The buyer has paid the down payment for the vehicle order. This is the first payment received for a financed order.

### Reservation Paid

The buyer has paid the reservation fee at Checkout. This is the first payment received for a cash order.

### Financing Guaranteed

### Fully Paid
